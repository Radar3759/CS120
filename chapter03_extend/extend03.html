                <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
                
                <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
                <p>Using descriptive file names makes it easier to know what the image is frmo the file name and helps improve search engine optimization.</p>
                
                <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
                <p>To resize the file 'html5.jpg', I used Paint.</p>
                
                <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
                <p>The original size of the file 'html5.jpg' was 2121px x 1414px </p>
                
                <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
                <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
                <img src="./images/html5.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="333" width="500">
                
                <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
                <p>The online image compressor I used was: compressor.io. The original file size was 28.5kb. The reduced file size was 7.36kb.</p>
                
                <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
                <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
                <img src="./images/html5_min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="333" width="500">
                
                <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
                <p>The compressed version looks different from the original version in subtle ways, like the blue doesn't seem quite as rich and the lines around the hand and text aren't as crisp. On it's own, it would be fine, but in direct comparisson to the original, it looks like a mock up/placeholder version.</p>

                <!-- Insert your SVG code below this comment -->
                <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice" role="img" height="500px" width="500px">
                        <title>A gradient Square</title>
                        <linearGradient id="gradient">
                                <stop class="begin" offset="0%" stop-color="blue" />
                                <stop class="end" offset="100%" stop-color="red" />
                        </linearGradient>
                        <rect x="0" y="0" width="100" height="100" style="fill:url(#gradient)" />
                        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="35" style="fill:url(#gradient)" />
                </svg>
                
                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>I used the SVG in HTML introduction from MDN. They provided a simple base code. I changed the title, added a width and height of the SVG image, increased the radius of the circle, and used different colors.</p>
